# NomadTask-Clone
Clone of the https://nomadtask.com/ website


I gave myself a challenge to build a task reward website because I just wanted to and was curious as to how the work behind the scenes
and what better way to do that than build one yourself. I was already familiar with nomadtask so I decide to make it's clone just to satisfy my curiosity.

I took me a week to finish the frontend (because I had nothing better to do with my life) the following week I started working on the back end Django is my goto backend framework because it is easy to maintain and also scalable (don't the media tell you other wise). I faceed some challenges though during the integration process which took another week after mucch googling (stackoverflow) I was able to rectify the issues and smothen the rough edges.

So on estimate it took 3weeks and some days (let's just call it a month i'm a decimal guy) for the project to be fully complete the code is free to use and please don't forget to report any issues and also give me a follow and a shout out.
